AJAX : loading data into site while site is up.
Request is made after site has been up.

Disadvantage: No direct url to content. SEO becomes problematic. No Backbutton, no browser history.

XMLHTTPRequest go wiki XHR  = AJAX

jQuery.ajax()

What is JSONP?
normal ajax requests to other domains are not permitted.
generally works with relative path
JSONP does avoid making an actual AJAX-call behind the scenes.
Set data-type to JSONP

JSONP inserts a javascript src tag into calling page. this tag gets data and appends it to a function which is then called in jquery.ajax().success()

jQuery.get() and jQuery.post() instead of using jQuery.ajax()


COFFEE-SCRIPT

@ = "this."
even in Coffeescript you can or cannot use braces to introduce arguments in functions and for function-calls

string interpolation is possible in coffeescript


coffee folder
coffee -w -0 js/ js -c coffee/

-w means watching, every change is compiled directly.

js is placed within a wrapper function: to make a function orvrariable globally available do
window.add = add


assumedly this is the same for sass
