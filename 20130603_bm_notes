git remote add origin https://github.com/tschannes/test2.git


git remote -v #show all remote repos

git branch first_branch #create branch
git checkout -b second_branch #create branch

git checkout first_branch (switch to branch)
git branch -a #showing all branches

git merge first_branch #always switch to branch that is supposed to be merged into

on long running branches, merge master into long running branch

master is clean, sub branches tend to be work in progress
