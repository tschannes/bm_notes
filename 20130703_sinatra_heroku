Dependencies?
Bundler jQuery co-founder Rails co-dev check name

bundler avoids conflicts
allows app-level gem dependenciy management

gem install bundler

Gemfile lists all gems (exclusively for Bundler)
bundle (run from project root)
Gemfile.lock is a system file used by Bundler, tells Bundler dependencies and versions. Not to be edited.
bundle show command used to figure out the gem versions

Rack:
provides interface for dev
Unifies API for web server web frameworks
Sits between web server (Thin, Unicorn...) and web framework (Sinatra, Rails...)
allows chaining apps: one request, dealt with in three apps. Kind of like chaining Unix-Commands

Using Rack:
create config.ru
rackup command starts app
