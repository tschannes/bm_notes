anonymous functions live and die with the variables they are assigned to. named functions live past the lifes of variables that might contain them.

Every javascript function contains arguments, an array-like objects. arguments.callee prints the function itself.

Naming functions makes them super-local in scope.

functions and objects are very similar
you can pass properties to functions too.

this in functions refers to the next containing object (it does never refer to it (the function) itself.

scope can be manipulated using "call(differentObject)", and "apply(differentObject)"
