Business Logic (domain logic) separate from UI

Architectural pattern that helps keeping thigns organized. MVC

M = Model, data and business logic
V = View, format and layout
C = Controller, handle requests from user, glue between model and view

Routing: points to the right controller and action (one per request)

Sprockets: allows the compilation of coffeescript and scss, sass

routes: file tells you what the user can do with any given application. It is like a summary of the app.

Gemfile: tells you what libraries are being used.

Schema: tells you what the db looks like, what sets exist.
