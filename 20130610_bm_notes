TESTING

Tests are like checklists.

Verification Testing: write tests after the code has been written (developing using manual testing and writing post-hoc test)

Test First: // TDD: n.times do write test then write code

Unit Tests, isolated chunks of code are being tested. Low level testing.

Integration Tests: builds on unit tests testing the resulting combination of units. (takes internals into perspective, dev perspective)

Functional and Acceptance Test: feature testing (avoids internals, user's perspective )'


Ruby - Testing framework
Test-unit, built into Ruby

Mini-test, rewrite of Test-unit

Rspec: Behaviour oriented (using natural-esque syntax)


A Good Test

Is Isolated: Should not impact other tests. Tests one thing only.

Tests the API, not internals: Test only public methods

Quick to write

Quick to run

Is Unique: keep it DRY



Arrange: Setup the test, preconditions

Act: Acto on the test object

Assert: Verify whether test does what was intended.



Active_merchant shopify: library to access payment gateway APIs



Usually you have several tests for single methods


workflow: work on separate branch, pull from master, merge back into master.


always start methods with "test_initialize_...."

If a test_case contains several checks, one of which fails, the entire test_case fails.

require 'test/unit'
require 'active_support'

DRY_up code
